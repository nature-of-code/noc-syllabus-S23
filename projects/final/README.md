# Final Projects

Your final project is an ~3 week assignment to be completed in two stages (proposal and implementation). The final project should be a creative project that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular aspect of JavaScript or programming.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)
3. If you prefer to focus your time on a final project that is more research or project proposal oriented, this is perfectly acceptable!

## Final Project Proposal

Put together a final project proposal. It's up to you to best present your idea, but some things I would suggest are:

- **Collect inspirations**: How did you become interested in this idea? quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills.
- **Collect source material**: drawings, images, videos, sounds, text
- **Collect code**: your own sketches and/or other people's sketches.
- **Collect ideas for title**
- **Collect ideas for 1-sentence description?**
- **Context?** Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- **Collect questions for your classmates.**
  - What are you unsure of? Conceptually and technically.

Stay tuned for an update regarding format for proposal sharing and feedback.

### Guidelines for Proposal Feedback

1. Is the idea clear? Is there a clearly stated goal? What do you understand / not understand?
2. What about scope? Can it be done in such a short period of time under current circumstances?
3. Suggestions for relevant tutorials, reference projects, or other resources?
4. Are there ways this project can be "remote" user tested? What questions would you want to ask?

## Final Project Documentation

To complete the course, please post your final project documentation to a web page (blog post is fine) and submit on the class Brightspace. The deadline is Monday, May 10th, however, if you need more time, there is flexibility so please be in touch. Additionally, see Brightspace for sign-ups to share your work over Zoom.

It's up to you to figure out how to best document your project, here are some loose guidelines if you aren't sure what to include.

* Title
* Sketch link
* One sentence description
* Project summary (250-500 words)
* Inspiration: How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills, etc.
* Process: How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
* Audience/Context: Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
* Code references: What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project? (You must cite the source of any code you use in code comments with the exception of examples specifically provided by The Nature of Code book.)
* Next steps: If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
