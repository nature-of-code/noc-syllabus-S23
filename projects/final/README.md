# Final Projects

Your final project is an ~3 week assignment to be completed in three stages (proposal, prototype, and final). The project should be a creative project that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular aspect of JavaScript or programming.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)
3. If you prefer to focus your time on a final project that is more research or project proposal oriented, this is perfectly acceptable!

## Final Project Proposal (Due April 12/13)

Put together a final project proposal. It's up to you to best present your idea, but some things I would suggest are:

- **Collect inspirations**: How did you become interested in this idea? quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills.
- **Collect source material**: drawings, images, videos, sounds, text
- **Collect code**: your own sketches and/or other people's sketches.
- **Collect ideas for title**
- **Collect ideas for 1-sentence description?**
- **Context?** Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- **Collect questions for your classmates.**
  - What are you unsure of? Conceptually and technically.

Stay tuned for an update regarding format for proposal sharing and feedback.

### Guidelines for Proposal Feedback

1. Is the idea clear? Is there a clearly stated goal? What do you understand / not understand?
2. What about scope? Can it be done in such a short period of time under current circumstances?
3. Suggestions for relevant tutorials, reference projects, or other resources?
4. Are there ways this project can be "remote" user tested? What questions would you want to ask?

## Final Project Testing (April 26/27)

The testing will follow a speed "round robin" format. The class will be divided into two groups and we'll do two rounds. For each round half the students will set up on a laptop in the class room and the other half will "view" or "interact with" or "listen to" your project for ~5-7 minutes. We'll rotate so that all "testers" will try each project and provide feedback.

It's up to you to design your "testing". It can mean something different for different projects. For an interactive web page, it's pretty obvious what to do. For a physical installation or performance or twitter bot, this will be more difficult. The "rule" that we will try to adhere to is no explaining of the project until after the user has viewed/interacted.

If you are not sure how to design your testing, e-mail me and we'll discuss. [Schedule and groups are on the course wiki](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-syllabus-S23/wiki).

## Final Project Documentation

To complete the course, please post your final project documentation to a web page (blog post is fine) and submit on the course wiki. The deadline is [TBD], however, if you need more time, there is flexibility so please be in touch.

It's up to you to figure out how to best document your project, here are some loose guidelines if you aren't sure what to include.

- Title
- Sketch link
- One sentence description
- Project summary (250-500 words)
- Inspiration: How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills, etc.
- Process: How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
- Audience/Context: Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- Code references: What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project? (You must cite the source of any code you use in code comments with the exception of examples specifically provided by The Nature of Code book.)
- Next steps: If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
