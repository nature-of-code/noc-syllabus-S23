## Simulation Project

Now is the time to take the concepts from the first 6 weeks and apply them to a project idea. This "mid-semester exercise" can be anything that builds off of or is inspired by the material from the motion and physics material. It does not need to be a "fully realized thing" -- it can be a visual experiment in progress or a piece of a larger project you are building for another context (thesis, another class, etc.). It can be continuation of one of your previous exercises that further develops the concepts there, perhaps inspired by some of the feedback you received or any lingering ideas that you want to explore. You should also feel free to think non-traditionally, i.e. your project need not be a Processing or p5.js sketch.

Here are some ideas for projects / technical exercises if you are feeling stuck:

- Extend one or more of the examples into 3D.
- Design a single creature (that you imagine living in a larger eco-system). Consider the design of the creature's physical form and how that animates in addition to its movement throughout the canvas itself.
- Investigate other interactions (beyond keyboard and mouse) and a physics environment (i.e. computer vision, machine learning, physical computing sensors, etc.)
- Use physics simulation to fabricate something -- a print, a sculpture, etc.
- Apply the concepts of motion to non-visual media, what does it mean for video playback or sound synthesis to respond to forces and emulate physical behaviors.

Document your project in a blog post and come prepared to share your work for ~3-5 minutes. You are not required to have a slide deck, however, you might find slides useful to help you plan and structure your demo. Additional, document your work in a a blog post (or other web page). 

Consider including:

* Title
* Sketch link
* One sentence description
* Summary (250-500 words)
* Inspiration: How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills, etc.
* Process: How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
* Code references: What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project? (You must cite the source of any code you use in code comments. Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines at the bottom of this page.)
* Next steps: If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
