# Evaluation for IMA (Undergrad)

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

- 25% Participation
- 50% Assignments
- 25% Final project

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course. Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.

## Assignment Grading

There will be regular assignments that are relevant the class material. These assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording, code, and video all qualify based on the assignment) on a web platform of your choice. You are required to link to your assignment from the course repo (you may choose to use a privately shared google doc or password protected website if you prefer.) The due dates are specified on the assignment page.

It is expected that you will spend 4 to 6 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Assignment documentation is expected to be 200 to 500 words in length unless otherwise specified.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0** | **Missing**: Student did not submit assignment.                                                              |

| **3** | **Outstanding**: The assignment has a highly creative concept and above and beyond documentation.            |

### Criteria (aka “how to get a 3”)

#### Project Documentation

- Is the **full story of the project** described including ideas, triumphs and failures? (It’s ok if the project doesn’t work or if you struggled, just tell the story!)
- Are **sources of inspiration and code examples** cited?
- Are **classmates and others who helped** you referenced?
- Is there **comprehensive visual documentation** (not just of the final result, but of the steps along the way)?
- Does it include **thoughts on next steps**?

#### Code

- Does the code demonstrate an **understanding of the course material**?
- **Are code sources credited** clearly in the comments?
- **Did the student go beyond the examples provided** by incorporating their own ideas or additional programming concepts not covered in class?
- Is it **legible or human readable**? Are things named appropriately?
- Is it **commented**? If the student were to look at the code in a month, would they be able to know what they did and why?
- Does the code leverage any **patterns** or **approaches** that are noteworthy?

#### Reading Responses

- Are **new questions** asked?
- Is there a **point of view** / argument made?
- Are **additional sources and references** mentioned?
- Is the post funny, novel, or otherwise unique?
