## Core Material

For each module, I will provide written and video tutorials on the topics. You can review whichever format suits you best. If the amount feels overwhelming, please reach out and we can help you narrow things down, and select a subset of the material to focus an exercise around. It's a lot!

## Assignment

- Option 1: Create an interactive soft body character with the toxiclibs.js VerletPhysics2D library [using the example built in class as a model](https://editor.p5js.org/noc_spring23/sketches/6AsvNEUFj). Try expanding the design from a triangle to your own custom shape. What can you incorporate visually such as colors, textures, or other enhancements?
- Option 2: Create a "force-directed graph" with the toxiclibs.js VerletPhysics2D library [using the example built in class as a model](https://editor.p5js.org/noc_spring23/sketches/6AsvNEUFj). What data do the particles (nodes) and springs (edges) represent? What can you incorporate visually such as colors, labels, or other enhancements?
